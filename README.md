## سوال ۱

what is .git folder ?
when we initialize a new git repository , this folder is created. this folder contains all the information which git needs to have in order to manage version control in our project. 
also we should notice that we shouldn't modify or delete anything manually in this folder and if we do that we'll have data loss. instead we should be using git commands.
if .git folder we usually have the following files :
1.config : contains configuration options for our git repository .
2.refs :contains refrences to different points in our git repository history.
3.HEAD : points to the current branch . ( or the commit we've checked out in our working directory )
4.objects :stores all the changes and files that we've commited to our hit repository.
5.hooks : contains scripts that git will run after or before certain events.

we can create .git folder both using git init and git clone commands.
by using git clone , we'll clone a copy from github.
